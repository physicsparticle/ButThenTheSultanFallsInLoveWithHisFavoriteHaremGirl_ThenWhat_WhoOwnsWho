lKcr5vkOxNs wouldnt you be in this conundrum then ... in love with s t r i p p e r

you know, when i was in high school, i use to work at a non-franchise ice cream shop, and we would get tips as single dollar bills ... so anyway, it was a joke that thats how i/we accumulated so many single dollar bills in our pockets after work

but you know, like wtf, more people know what a s t r i p p e r is than a computational biologist, i should just say that's what i do when some random persons asks, "yeah thats what i do, now leave me the fk alone"

totally a real song that use to play on the radio
